# What is codingnight&shy;ffm?

We'll have a proper kick-off to discuss ideas for coding nights.  
For now the **what** remains to be defined.

# Hangout - Bring your own project

You're currently working on a project and don't want to code home alone? Welcome to #codingnightffm hangouts! :)

Our next hangout will be on **Friday, May 24th**.  
We'll meet at the offices of [codemonauts](https://codemonauts.com/), GÃ¼nthersburgallee 19.  
Doors open from 6pm, you can join later of course. That's up to you. :)

There's gonna be free wifi and drinks, fellow coders to hang and chat with inclusive. ;)  
We can order in or grab a bite at the market on Friedberger Platz.

Want to come? Since space is limited, please give a heads-up or even register by putting your name here (via pull request at [github](https://github.com/emsuiko/codingnightffm/edit/master/README.md)).
